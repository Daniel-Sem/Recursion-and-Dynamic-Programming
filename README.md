# Recursion-and-Dynamic-Programming

The goal of this repository is to show the effectiveness of the recursive approach in solving some program problems.This method of solving problems is the most effective
for some of them, but not the best for all of  them. That's why some of the files contain both iterative and recursive solutions and compare their speed.
