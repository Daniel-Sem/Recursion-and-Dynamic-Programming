# Recursion-and-Dynamic-Programming

The goal of this repository is to show the effectiveness of the recursive approach in solving some program problems.This method of solving problems is the most effective
for some of them, but not the best for all of  them. That's why some of the files contain both iterative and recursive solutions and compare their speed.

Dynamic programming is a method that uses a more systematic approach to the problem and optimizes over ordinary recursion. Usually this algorithm remembers some of the
previous results so that we can avoid recalculating the results we already know.
